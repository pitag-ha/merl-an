(** Given a source code file [f] and a merlin query type [qt], we consider all
    locations in the file that the given query type can act on. Let's call the
    set of all those locations [population]. Then,
    [generate ~sample_size ~id_counter f qt] generates a sample set of size
    [min sample_size <popultion size>] of that population with integer IDs
    starting at [id_counter]. In case of success, it returns the generated
    sample set together with an updated [id_counter]. *)

val analyze :
  merlin:Merlin.t -> query_time:float -> repeats:int -> Data.t -> t -> float
(** [analyze ~merlin ~query_time ~repeats data samples] appends new analysis
    data to [data]. The data results from running [merlin] on the [samples]
    (notice that [samples] also contains info on the file and on the query type
    the samples are for); it runs the query [repeats] times. The new data is
    appended to [data] as a side-effect. The return value is the updated
    [query_time] (which is important to analyze the performance of this tool
    itself). *)
